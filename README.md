Tasky is a simple, intuitive task management application developed for Android, that uses the powerful and modern Kotlin programming language.

The application allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, providing a user-friendly interface for managing daily activities. Each task can have a description, and due date, offering a comprehensive overview of your tasks at a glance.


<h3>The app has following packages</h3>

1. data: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
1. di: Dependency providing classes using Dagger2.
1. ui: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModels.
1. utils: Utility classes.



Tasky leverages the power of Kotlin's coroutines for smooth and responsive performance, ensuring tasks are handled efficiently in the background without blocking the user interface.

The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, ensuring a clean, maintainable codebase. It uses Room for local data persistence, providing a robust SQLite abstraction layer.
